### Introduction

The data in this spreadsheet is a companion to the paper:

M. Halpern, Y. Zhu, V. J. Reddi, **"Mobile CPU's Rise to Power: Quantifying the Impact of Generational Mobile CPU Design Trends on Performance, Energy, and User Satisfaction"**, in the 22nd
Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), March, 2016.

The data can be found within the following three CSV files:
